A scanning synthesizer. Builds a connected grid of springs and reads
rows of them as sound signals for a whirly, surreal effect. Control
with number keys, some letter keys, and the mouse. Press 'm' to toggle
excitation with a microphone. (It probably won't start without a
microphone, even though it's not required.)

The easiest way to use this is to open Processing and paste the
contents of springy.pde into into it, then run. You need the Minim
add-on, though:
