A scanning synthesizer. Builds a connected grid of springs and reads
rows of them as sound signals for a whirly, surreal effect. Control
with number keys, some letter keys, and the mouse. Press 'm' to toggle
excitation with a microphone. (It probably won't start without a
microphone, even though it's not required.)
